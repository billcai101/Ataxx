# Projects

Ataxx is a board game that I recreated in Java. I represented the board using an array of arrays. I also used Regex to parse user inputs to allow the user to load speical commands. I also wrote an AI that used alpha beta pruning to find the optimal move to use.

Graphs is just a project demonstrating graph concepts such as breadth first traversal, depth first traversal, Djikstra's algorithm and A* search. 

Twitter contest bot is an automated bot that can follow and retweet using the TWIT api to make post and get requests.

SEC crawler is a scraper written in Python that uses the BeautifulSoup module to download files directly from the SEC website.

Reinforcement is a project done in my Artificial Intelligence in which I implemented reinforcement learning for a pacman game.
