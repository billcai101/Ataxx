# Projects

Ataxx is a board game that I recreated in Java. I represented the board using an array of arrays. I also wrote an AI that used alpha beta pruning to find the optimal move to use.

Graphs is just a project demonstrating graph concepts such as breadth first traversal, depth first traversal, Djikstra's algorithm and A* search.
